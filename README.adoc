= Custom theming for Cameo/MagicDraw

== Problem statement

Cameo/MagicDraw on Linux operating system does not look nearly as professional as in Windows.
This is due fact that Cameo/Magicdraw uses 
the standard look and feel which is not visually appealing and
the fonts are very small, 
especially on a smaller (14-inch) screen.

== Solution

I created a plugin enabling users to use the wonderful open source 
FlatLAF look and feel theme (https://www.formdev.com/flatlaf/). 

== Demo

== Download release

You can directly download the release without build from the following address:

https://github.com/modeldriven-hu/lookandfeel/releases/tag/1.0.0

== Build the project

=== Requirements

- Cameo/MagicDraw latest
- Java JDK 11
- Maven

=== Check out the repository

`git clone https://github.com/modeldriven-hu/lookandfeel.git`

=== Configure environment variable

This project makes use of `pixi` to mangage the development environment.

=== Building

Execute `pixi run build` in the git folder.
https://pixi.sh/latest/#alternative-installation-methods

The following shows all of the defined tasks.
[source,bash]
----
pixi run
----

== Installation

[source,bash]
----
pixi run install
----

The install has several steps.

* install the plugin zip
* install the flatlaf jar into `CAMEO_ROOT/lib`
* update the classpath in the manifest

The first two steps are simple (read the `pixi.toml` for details).
The third needs a bit of explanation.

=== Modify the classpath

Although Cameo is able to load our plugin at startup but it does not know about the dependent FlatLaf library.
The solution for the problem is to add the library to the classpath of Cameo directly.

==== Revise classpath.jar 

There is a modified copy of the MANIFEST.MF in link:resources/MANIFEST.MF.
A fresh copy can be retrieved with the following.
[source,bash]
----
pixi run manifest xf
----

Add the text `flatlaf-2.5.jar` to the end of `resources/MANIFEST.MF` at the end right after `y.jar`.

Replace the `MANIFEST.MF` in the `CAMEO_ROOT/lib/classpath.jar`.
[source,bash]
----
pixi run manifest uf
----

=== Restart

In order to use the plugin you need to restart Cameo.

== Usage

In the `Options` menu select `Flat look and feel` then select
the desired theme and press Apply.
